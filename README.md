Senior Software Developer | Azure Cloud Aficionado

## üßê About Me
Hey there, I'm Pedro Povoleri, an experienced software engineer with more than a decade in the field. My main gig is C#, and I have a boatload of experience in software architecture, Scrum methodologies, and the wonderful world of Azure cloud computing. When it comes to databases, I've got my hands dirty with MSSQL, and I'm no stranger to the magic of containers. Lately, I've been rocking the full stack with Angular 15, building modern and snazzy web applications that users love. Plus, I'm well-versed in Azure, where I've mastered Azure Functions, Azure Storage, Azure SQL Databases, Azure Kubernetes Service, and even the art of streamlined deployments with Bicep.

## ‚ö° Technologies & Expertise

I'm a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to tech:

### Front-end Wizardry with Angular 15
- I'm in my element crafting dazzling web applications using Angular 15 and its gang of tools. Whether it's wrangling Angular templates, directives, services, or getting cozy with APIs and backend systems, I've got it covered.

### Backend Mastery with .NET 7
- My backend game is strong with .NET 7, the latest and greatest from Microsoft. I specialize in building robust backend systems that tick like clockwork. And let's not forget about SQL - I've danced with MSSQL databases and made them sing.

### Robust Full-Stack Magic
- Building full-stack systems is my jam, and I specialize in delivering systems that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable. Profound knowledge of software architecture principles and design patterns, coupled with versatility in various technologies, ensures the delivery of high-quality solutions.

### Cloud Architect Extraordinaire with Azure
- When it comes to the cloud, Azure is my playground. I've whipped up cloud-based systems using Azure Functions, stored data in Azure Storage, mastered Azure SQL Databases, orchestrated with Azure Kubernetes Service, and streamlined deployments with Bicep.

### DevOps Guru with a Side of Azure Bicep
- Proficiency in Azure DevOps equips me for adept project management and streamlined Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes. I navigate agile planning, Git repositories, and automated build and deployment pipelines within Azure DevOps to efficiently manage and deliver software projects.
